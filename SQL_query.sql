Project name: Supply Chain Analysis
Created by  : Ajaikumar A
RDBMS       : Microsoft SQL Server


Description :- 
In this project, we will try to answer some business questions by analyzing the supply chain data of a company.
		
	
		
Note :-
In this SQL file, we will be analysing the data in order to answer some business questions.

Dataset is divided into 7 tables.

1) OrderList (orders that need to be assigned a route)
2) FreightRates (all available couriers, the weight gaps for each lane, and rates associated)Â 
3) PlantPorts (allowed links between the warehouses and shipping ports)
4) ProductsPerPlant (all supported warehouse-product combinations)
5) VmiCustomers (lists all special cases, where the warehouse is only allowed to support specific customers, while any other non-listed warehouse can supply any customer)
6) WhCapacities (warehouse capacities measured in the number of orders per day)
7) WhCosts (cost associated with storing the products in a given warehouse measured in dollars per unit)

We will be answering the following questions:
